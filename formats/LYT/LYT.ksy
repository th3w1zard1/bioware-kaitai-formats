doc: |
  LYT (Layout) files define how area geometry is assembled from room models and where
  interactive elements (doors, tracks, obstacles, art placeables) are positioned.
  The game engine uses LYT files to load and position room models (MDL files) and
  determine door placement points for area transitions.

  Format Overview:
  - LYT files are ASCII text with a deterministic order
  - Structure: beginlayout, optional sections, then donelayout
  - Every section declares a count and then lists entries on subsequent lines
  - Sections (in order): roomcount, trackcount, obstaclecount, doorhookcount, artplaceablecount, walkmeshRooms
  - All sections are optional but must appear in order if present
  - Line endings: \n (Unix) or \r\n (Windows)
  - Whitespace: Leading/trailing whitespace is typically ignored, tokens separated by space/tab
  - Case sensitivity: Room names, door names, and model ResRefs are case-insensitive

  Complete Syntax:
  ```
  beginlayout
  roomcount <N>
    <room_model> <x> <y> <z>
  trackcount <N>
    <track_model> <x> <y> <z>
  obstaclecount <N>
    <obstacle_model> <x> <y> <z>
  doorhookcount <N>
    <room_name> <door_name> [0] <x> <y> <z> <qx> <qy> <qz> <qw> [optional floats]
  artplaceablecount <N>
    <artplaceable_model> <x> <y> <z>
  walkmeshRooms <N>
    <room_model>
  donelayout
  ```

  Coordinate System:
  - Units are meters in the same left-handed coordinate system as MDL models
  - Positions (x, y, z) are world-space coordinates
  - Quaternions (qx, qy, qz, qw) define door orientation in world space
  - Y-axis is typically vertical (up), X and Z form the horizontal plane

  Room Definitions (roomcount):
  - Each room entry specifies a room model (ResRef, max 16 chars, no spaces) and position
  - Room models reference MDL/MDX files that define the room geometry
  - Room names are case-insensitive for matching purposes
  - Format: <room_model> <x> <y> <z>
  - Example: "M17mg_01a 100.0 100.0 0.0"
  - Rooms are the primary building blocks of area layouts
  - Multiple rooms can be placed to create complex area geometry

  Track Definitions (trackcount):
  - Tracks are booster elements used exclusively in swoop racing mini-games (KotOR II)
  - Each track entry specifies a track model (ResRef, max 16 chars, no spaces) and position
  - Format: <track_model> <x> <y> <z>
  - Example: "M17mg_MGT01 0.0 0.0 0.0"
  - Optional section - most modules omit this entirely
  - Used in racing modules like Telos surface racing
  - Each track element represents a booster that provides speed boosts during racing

  Obstacle Definitions (obstaclecount):
  - Obstacles are hazard elements used exclusively in swoop racing mini-games (KotOR II)
  - Each obstacle entry specifies an obstacle model (ResRef, max 16 chars, no spaces) and position
  - Format: <obstacle_model> <x> <y> <z>
  - Example: "M17mg_MGO01 103.309 3691.61 0.0"
  - Optional section - most modules omit this entirely
  - Used in racing modules to create challenges and obstacles for the player
  - Each obstacle element represents a hazard placed along the racing track

  Door Hook Definitions (doorhookcount):
  - Door hooks bind door models to rooms for area transitions
  - Format varies by implementation:
    * PyKotor format: <room_name> <door_name> 0 <x> <y> <z> <qx> <qy> <qz> <qw>
    * xoreos format: <room_name> <door_name> <x> <y> <z> <qx> <qy> <qz> <qw> <unk1> <unk2>
  - Fields:
    - room_name: Target room name (must match a roomcount entry, case-insensitive)
    - door_name: Hook identifier (used in module files to reference this door, case-insensitive)
    - 0: Reserved field (PyKotor format only, always 0, skipped during parsing)
    - x, y, z: Position of door origin in world space (float, meters)
    - qx, qy, qz, qw: Quaternion orientation for door rotation (float)
    - unk1, unk2: Unknown float values (xoreos format only, typically 0.0)
  - Example (PyKotor): "M02ac_02h door_01 0 170.475 66.375 0.0 0.707107 0.0 0.0 -0.707107"
  - Example (xoreos): "Room01 Door01 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 16.0 17.0"
  - Door hooks define where doors are placed in rooms to create area transitions
  - The quaternion (qx, qy, qz, qw) defines the door's orientation in world space
  - Door hooks are separate from BWM hooks - BWM hooks define interaction points,
    while LYT doorhooks define door placement positions

  Art Placeable Definitions (artplaceablecount):
  - Art placeables are decorative elements that can be placed in areas
  - Format: <artplaceable_model> <x> <y> <z>
  - Each entry specifies an art placeable model (ResRef, max 16 chars, no spaces) and position
  - Optional section - supported by xoreos, not all implementations support this
  - Used for decorative elements that don't affect gameplay
  - Example: "AP01 20.0 21.0 22.0"

  Walkmesh Rooms (walkmeshRooms):
  - Walkmesh rooms section is only relevant for Jade Engine (Dragon Age, Mass Effect)
  - Format: <room_model> (one per line, no position data)
  - Each entry specifies a room model that has walkmesh data
  - Optional section - KotOR implementations typically ignore this
  - Marks rooms that contain walkmesh geometry for pathfinding
  - Example: "WMRoom01"
  - When present, sets the canWalk flag on matching room entries

  Implementation Differences:
  - PyKotor: Reads doorhooks with "0" field (10 tokens: room, door, 0, x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw)
  - xoreos: Reads doorhooks without "0" field (10 tokens: room, door, x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw, unk1, unk2)
  - reone: Only supports roomcount section (simplified implementation)
  - Most implementations support: roomcount, trackcount, obstaclecount, doorhookcount
  - xoreos additionally supports: artplaceablecount, walkmeshRooms

  File Structure Details:
  - Header: "beginlayout" (required, case-sensitive)
  - Footer: "donelayout" (required, case-sensitive)
  - Section keywords: "roomcount", "trackcount", "obstaclecount", "doorhookcount", "artplaceablecount", "walkmeshRooms" (case-sensitive)
  - Indentation: Some implementations use indentation (typically 3 spaces) for entries, but it's not required
  - Empty lines: Ignored by all implementations
  - Comments: Not officially supported, but some implementations may skip lines starting with #

  Relationship to Other Formats:
  - MDL/MDX: Room models referenced by ResRef in roomcount entries
  - BWM: Walkmeshes loaded alongside LYT rooms, door hooks may reference BWM transition points
  - VIS: Visibility graph for areas with LYT rooms, controls which rooms are visible
  - ARE: Area files that load LYT layouts to assemble the area geometry

  All implementations (reone, xoreos, KotOR.js, Kotor.NET)
  parse identical tokens for the core sections. KotOR-Unity mirrors the same structure.
  xoreos extends the format with additional sections for Jade Engine compatibility.

      Multiple rooms can be placed to create complex area layouts.

      Example: "M17mg_01a 100.0 100.0 0.0"

  track_entry:
    doc: |
      A single track entry in the trackcount section.
      Format: <track_model> <x> <y> <z>

      This section is optional - most modules omit it entirely.
      Used in racing modules like Telos surface racing.
      Each track element represents a booster that provides speed boosts during racing.

  doorhook_entry_pykotor:
    doc: |
      A single doorhook entry in the doorhookcount section (PyKotor format).

      Fields:
      - room_name: Target room name (must match a roomcount entry, case-insensitive, max 16 chars)

      Door hooks define where doors are placed in rooms to create area transitions.
      The quaternion (qx, qy, qz, qw) defines the door's orientation in world space.
